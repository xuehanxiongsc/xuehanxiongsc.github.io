子曰：温故而知新，可以为师矣
Confucius: If a man keeps cherishing his old knowledge, 
so as continually to be acquiring new, he may be a teacher of others.

You are all computer scientists.
You know what FINITE AUTOMATA can do. 
You know what TURING MACHINES can do. 
For example, Finite Automata can add but not multiply.
Turing Machines can compute any computable function.
Turing machines are incredibly more powerful than Finite Automata.
Yet the only difference between a FA and a TM is that 
the TM, unlike the FA, has paper and pencil.
Think about it. 
It tells you something about the power of writing.
Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.
With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.

Keep on writing.
